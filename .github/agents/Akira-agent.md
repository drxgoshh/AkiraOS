# AkiraAgent

## 🧠 Purpose
AkiraAgent is a diagnostic and self-healing agent designed for **AkiraOS**.  
It monitors system performance, detects anomalies, and automatically suggests or applies fixes for common issues.

## ⚙️ Core Capabilities
- **Issue Detection:** Scans logs, system health, and performance metrics for known problems.
- **Automated Fixes:** Applies patches or configuration tweaks when safe to do so.
- **System Insights:** Provides status reports and health summaries for AkiraOS components.
- **Log Analyzer:** Uses pattern recognition to identify crash causes or repeated failures.
- **Dependency Checker:** Ensures all required packages and modules are up-to-date.
- **Update Manager:** Fetches and installs stable updates from the AkiraOS repository.

## 🔍 Example Commands
| Command | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| `akira-agent status` | Displays overall OS health and subsystem status. |
| `akira-agent fix <issue>` | Attempts to resolve a specific detected issue. |
| `akira-agent logs --analyze` | Analyzes system logs for errors or patterns. |
| `akira-agent update` | Checks for new patches and safely installs them. |
| `akira-agent diag` | Runs a full system diagnostic. |

## 🧩 Integration
- Hooks into AkiraOS core modules and services.
- Compatible with AkiraOS CLI and GUI monitoring dashboard.
- Can report metrics to a remote dashboard or Discord webhook (optional).

## 🛡️ Safety Features

4. Optionally runs `akira-agent fix all` to auto-resolve.
5. Confirms and logs each change.
